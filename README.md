Event management Practical

I have practical done with Laravel MVC framework. Below is the mention some steps & overiview for it.

1. Once take clone of repository then first setup the project with necessary changes on .env file for Database configuration and also set app url with project url.

	Run command: 
				i) composer install
				ii) npm install
				iii) npm run development  
				vi) php artisan migrate (for database migration)



2. Setup project then run project and first display Event management listing page.

3. On event list page, Display all event list with Create New Event and Edit, view, delete events.

Notes: 
	1. I have added screenshort for all pages fuctionality on practical_screenshort folder. You can overview of it.
	2. I have used database migation on practical. so once run amove mention command of migrate then database created successfully.
